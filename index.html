                <strong>Mihajlo Idvorski Pupin, Ph.D., LL.D. (Serbian Cyrillic: Михајло Идворски Пупин; 9 October 1858 – 12 March 1935)</strong>, also known as Michael I. Pupin, was a Serbian American physicist and physical chemist. Pupin is best known for his numerous patents, including a means of greatly extending the range of long-distance
                telephone communication by placing loading coils (of wire) at predetermined intervals along the transmitting wire (known
                as "pupinization"). Pupin was a founding member of National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) on March 3, 1915, which later became
                NASA. In 1914, Pupin formed "Fund Pijade Aleksić-Pupin" within the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts[19] to commemorate his
                mother Olimpijada for all the support she gave him through life. Fund assets were used for helping schools in old Serbia
                and Macedonia, and scholarships were awarded every year on the Saint Sava day. One street in Ohrid was named after
                Mihajlo Pupin in 1930 to honour his efforts. He also established a separate "Mihajlo Pupin fund" which he funded from
                his own property in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, which he later gave to "Privrednik" for schooling of young people and for
                prizes in "exceptional achievements in agriculture", as well as for Idvor for giving prizes to pupils and to help the
                church district.[20]
                
                Thanks to Pupin's donations, the library in Idvor got a reading room, schooling of young people for agriculture sciences
                was founded, as well as the electrification and waterplant in Idvor.[21] Pupin established a foundation in the museum of
                Natural History and Arts in Belgrade. The funds of the foundation were used to purchase artistic works of Serbian
                artists for the museum and for the printing of certain publications. Pupin invested a million dollars in the funds of
                the foundation.[20]
                
                In 1909,[citation needed] he established one of the oldest Serbian emigrant organizations in the United States called
                "Union of Serbs – Sloga." The organization had a mission to gather Serbs in immigration and offer help, as well as
                keeping ethnic and cultural values. This organization later merged with three other immigrant societies.[22]
                
                Other emigrant organizations in to one large Serbian national foundation, and Pupin was one of its founders and a
                longtime president (1909–1926).
                
                He also organized "Kolo srpskih sestara" (English: Circle of Serbian sisters) who gathered help for the Serbian Red
                Cross, and he also helped the gathering of volunteers to travel to Serbia during the First World War with the help of
                the Serbian patriotic organization called the "Serbian National Defense Council" which he founded and led. Later, at the
                start of the Second World War this organization was rehabilitated by Jovan Dučić and worked with the same goal. Pupin
                guaranteed the delivery of food supplies to Serbia with his own resources, and he also was the head of the committee
                that provided help to the victims of war. He also founded the Serbian society for helping children which provided
                medicine, clothes and shelter for war orphans.[23]
